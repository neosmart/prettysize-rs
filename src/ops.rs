//! Implementations of basic arithmetic operations on/between `Size` values.
//!
//! Only operations that make sense are implemented, e.g. while it is OK to add two `Size` objects,
//! it does not make sense to multiply them. Meanwhile, `17 MiB / 2` is perfectly rational and
//! returns a size of `3.5 MiB`, but `12 KB + 14` isn't (as the addition of a scalar value to a
//! sized type is undefined) -- on the other hand, `12 KB + 14 B` is both supported and perfectly
//! fine.
//!
//! Some examples of supported mathematical operations:
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), doc = "```ignore")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "std", doc = "```")]
//! use size::Size;
//!
//! // Perform scalar multiplication/division on a `Size`
//! let s1 = Size::from_mib(13) / 2;
//! assert_eq!(s1, Size::from_mib(6.5_f32));
//!
//! // Perform addition or subtraction of two `Size` instances,
//! // regardless of their underlying types
//! let s2 = Size::from_kib(4) + Size::from_mb(8);
//! assert_eq!(s2.bytes(), 8_004_096);
//!
//! // Express the negative difference between two sizes
//! let s3 = Size::from_mib(12) - Size::from_mib(14.2_f64);
//! assert_eq!(s3, Size::from_kib(-2252.8));
//! ```
//! 
//! Some other things you cannot do are multiply/divide two sizes (did you mean to multiply one size
//! by a scalar value instead?), add/subtract scalar values from sizes (you can call `size.bytes()`
//! then do all the scalar math you like, however), or perform mathematical operations that exceed
//! the bounds of the intermediate type (`f64` by default or `i64` if `no_std` mode is used).
//!
//! A current limitation of this crate that may be revisited at a later date is that mathematical
//! operations (or textual representation, for that matter) of that result in a size that exceeds
//! the bounds of an `i64` are not supported (i.e. they will not be promoted to a
//! floating-point-backed `Size` instance) and will panic in debug mode or silently fail with
//! undefined results in release mode.
